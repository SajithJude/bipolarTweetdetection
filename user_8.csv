So much in her life

Grows stronger

To hurt her

It really was more like
‘Mom mom mom’

"My sweet little angel
Head full of hair
Came into my life
With such gusto
Precious and fair
He was perfection
Counted fingers
&amp; all his toes
He loved the sun
Blonde hair shined
So bright
But nothing could beat
His great big smile
My darling beacon
My light

Where boundaries
Are fragile
Woven with an
Intricate lace of
Sorrow

Deeply from
The harbinger of
Death
Never arrogant

Feel the pain
Turning to ash
Waiting for her own
Life to be reborn

Into a foggy wet dreary

In her mind
A tapestry forms
Magnificent scenery

"Hospitals are her bane
Not many understand
Why it harms her
To go near one
All the darkness
Sadness
Hopelessness
Makes her weep
Her #empathy
Is strong
As an empath
She feels it all
Making herself ill
She yearns to
Heal all in pain

Memory to hold

Staring up at the starry skies

Brought her happiness

A free trip to the ocean
With her family was the

That time was precious
Forgetting briefly
Her chemo port, hair falling out
The constant pain &amp; nausea
She is now
Awaiting darkness with

Was a mistake
No way could they be
Friends after all the pain
So she gathered all he left her
Went to the ocean, built a fire
As she tossed his items in
All the antagonism, unhappiness 
Hurt dissolved
She bathed in the ocean
Cleansing him away

"She is not a #riddle to 
Be figured out
Seriously,
Is it unusual
That she wishes to be
Cared for
Wanted
Seduced
Loved
Be his best friend
She wants to be his
One and only
Is that really a riddle?

"Tried as she might
She just couldn’t
Understand his reasoning
His logic was a #riddle to her
Any human in their right
Mind would never watch
Humanity burn down with
A smile on their face
He scared her, death seems
To excite him and he was her
Only chance for survival...

One day she met him
A soul mason, he rebuilt
Her soul brick by brick
Using his love as mortar 
Smoothing away 
The rocks &amp; ridges
Replacing one piece with
A silent stone
Sealing it with a kiss
Promising forever
She will be safe

"Sometimes of late
I can barely function
I am so lonely 
I cry myself to sleep
Lying alone in
My bed is disheartening
No one to talk to
No one to hold me
I just want to 
Curl up in bed
And never get up
It’s so hard to 
Rise and keep 
Moving
But I do
I’m still hoping....

Is it because

Finally be free
Of him 
Instead every morning
I wake up in tears
Please, please

The shore was thunderous
Stormy skies darkened 
The horizon 
Rain poured down
The storm kept 
Even the heartiest
Of seafarers away
Suddenly
The skies parted 
And the sun peaked
Through the dense clouds
Giving a bright light,
My beacon of hope.

Asleep for so very long 
Hidden deep within me
Lying dormant 
Waiting to germinate
Slowly growing by his kindness
Warmed by his love
Feritilized with passions
My confidante, my lover

Glowing from the ambient lights
It was both beautiful
And sad
Holiday cheer abounded
But it’s time is almost over
Then off to work I go.

Away in the night sky
Each beacon of light 
Disappearing as if they never Existed
Each one a dying star
Being snuffed out like a candle
Leaving only a memory of its Existence.

Only lovers can

Note to myself
Telling myself that
I am loved

Those words
How had I forgotten
To remember ...

Dimmed to

"I can’t help
But look 
Upon this world
Through rose
Colored vision 
For when I
Hear the timber
Of his voice
The blood
In my veins
Rushes to 
My head
Making me 
Feel faint
With want
Leaving me
Breathless 
My eyes fill
With love
As his lips
Burn his poetry
